# Original Compiler 

This is the original PureScript compiler, written in Haskell. It is used as a reference implementation for the new Rust-based compiler. The goal of the new compiler is to be faster and more memory efficient than the original, while still producing the same output for the same input. 

If you are stuck implementing a feature in the new compiler, you can refer to the original compiler's source code to see how it is implemented.
